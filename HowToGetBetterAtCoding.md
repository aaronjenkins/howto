# How to get better at coding


## Readings
* [Clean Code](https://www.investigatii.md/uploads/resurse/Clean_Code.pdf)
  * Don't let this long PDF deter you, its a lof of screenshots of code in various languages
* [The Mythical Man Month](https://www.amazon.com/Mythical-Man-Month-Software-Engineering-Anniversary/dp/0201835959/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2CNBA8Y6QDGYH&keywords=mythical+man+month&qid=1580766200&sprefix=mythical+%2Caps%2C193&sr=8-1)
